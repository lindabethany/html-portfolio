<h1>The Best Movies According to Linda</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Gone with the Wind</h3>
<p>
  A beautiful film that encapsulates civilian sentiments surrounding The Civil
  War.
</p>

<h3>Pride and Predjudice</h3>
<p>
  The music, the cinematography, the acting is all chef's kiss. And that hand
  scene still makes me swoon.
</p>

<h3>A Walk to Remember</h3>
<p>
  This one is definitely a tear jerker, but the biggest lesson is that people
  can change and evolve.
